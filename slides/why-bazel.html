# What is GitOps?

.gitops-cd-pipeline[![GitOps Pipeline](img/gitops_cd_pipeline.png)]

1. The entire system is described declaratively
2. The canonical desired system state is versioned in VCS
3. Approved changes can be automatically applied to the system
4. Software agents ensure correctness and alert on divergence

# Why we want to use GitOps approach?

* Faster development
* System easy to reason about
* Easy, fast delivery
* Easier compliance and auditing
* ..
* Overall, allows __smaller__ teams, to deliver __better__ products __quicker__

## Primer
### Declarative application management

---

# Super simple app example

```yaml
# less hello-k8s.yaml (1/2)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-kubernetes
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-kubernetes
```

---
# Super simple app example

```yaml
# less hello-k8s.yaml (2/2)
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-kubernetes
spec:
  replicas: 3
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-kubernetes
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-kubernetes
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-kubernetes
        image: paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: MESSAGE
          value: I just deployed this on Kubernetes!
```

---

# Plain text - most basic approach

## Deploying

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f hello-k8s.yaml
```

## Updating

```bash
$ vim deployment.yaml
$ git commit ..
$ kubectl apply -f hello-k8s.yaml
```

---

# Plain text - most basic approach

## Rolling back

```bash
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/hello-k8s.yaml

# In case of having version control
# even better approach:

$ git checkout <previously_working_commit_hash>

$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Troubles with trusting rollout
- History limit may be reached before stabilization
- Information about history may be corrupted
- Cluster may fail and wipe history
- Virtually, any problem with treating k8s as stateful

---

# Plain text - most basic approach
_ ~ Assuming having version control ~ _

## Advantages

* Explicit state
* Easy to reason about
* Deterministic, predictive behaviour
* Checks most of GitOps boxes (images are not accounted for)

---

# Plain text - most basic approach

## Disadvantages

* What if ..
  * There is more than 1 flavour of application setup (i.e. different feature flags)
  * There is more than 1 deployment environment (i.e. test env uses different external URLs than dev)
  * There is more than 1 deployment environment flavour (i.e. OpenShift, AKS)
* Let the copy-pasta ensue - the repository is quickly in terrible state
* Typo, typo, typo..
* Using CRDs require some work/scripting
* Helm? Other tools? Everything has to be incorporated manually (or via scripting -> more messy code)
---

# Templating - jinja2 and friends

* We are transforming `hello-k8s.yaml` into template (for example: `hello-k8s.j2`)
```bash
$ jinja2 -f config.ini hello-k8s.j2 | kubectl apply -f -
```

* We can even do this per configuration vector and save to versioned files
```bash
for filename in ./configs/*.ini; do
jinja2 -f "${filename}" hello-k8s.j2 > "./deploys/${filename}"
done
...
$ git commit ..
$ kubectl apply -f ./deploys
```

---

# Templating - jinja2 and friends

## Advantages

* Retained most of GitOps goodness
  * Explicit state
  * Deterministic, predictive behaviour
  * Checks most of GitOps boxes (images are not accounted for)
* We can somehow deal with multi-vector configuration

---

# Templating - jinja2 and friends

## Disadvantages

* Not so easy to reason about 
  * Creeping templating spaghethii, if-else logic etc.
  * How change in template affects everything else?
* Typo, typo, typo..
* Using CRDs require some work/scripting
* Still know nothing about images
* Helm? Other tools? Everything has to be incorporated manually (or via scripting -> more messy code)

---

# Helm

This is effectively jinja2 with some built-ins and implicit dependencies.

### 'Recommended workflow'
```bash
# Create chart
$ helm create hellok8s
# Modify j2 template to fit helm conventions
$ <Some text editing>
# Deploy away
$ helm install hello-k8s hellok8s/ --values hellok8s/values.yaml
```

### Upgrade / Rollback
```bash
$ helm upgrade hello-k8s hellok8s/ --values hellok8s/values.yaml

$ helm rollback hello-k8s n-1
```
---

# Helm

## Advantages

* We can somehow deal with multi-vector configuration
* Easy integration with myriad of production-grade manifests
* Handles most of use-cases that need minimal scripting (viz. wating for CRDs)

---

# Helm

## Disadvantages

* Not GitOps at all
* __DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT HELL__ (stupendously bad)
  * Leaking dependencies
  * Dysfunctional lockfiles
  * Barely working in lax environment
  * Buggy
* Implicit, hidden states
* Not so easy to reason about (templating hell)
* Typos, typos, typos
* Still know nothing about images

---

# Templating - helm

### 'Recommended workflow'
```bash
# Create chart

# Modify j2 template to fit helm conventions
$ <Some text editing>
# Materialize
$ helm template hellok8s/ --values hellok8s/values.yaml > deploys/hello-k8s.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f deploys/hello-k8s.yaml
```

### Upgrade / Rollback
```bash
$ git pull --rebase && kubectl apply -f deploys/hello-k8s.yaml
$ git checkout <hash> && kubectl apply -f deploys/hello-k8s.yaml
```

# Templating - helm

## Advantages

* Retained most of GitOps goodness
  * Explicit state
  * Deterministic, predictive behaviour
  * Checks most of GitOps boxes (images are not accounted for)
* We can somehow deal with multi-vector configuration
* With some scripting can use myriad of production grade manifests

---

# Overlays - Kustomize

Build final deployments by stacking "layers" of manifest

```bash
$ tree
.
|-- base                 # Materialized deployment
|   |-- hello-k8s.yaml
|   |-- kustomize.yaml
|-- overlays
|   |--production        # Only diff of changes
|       |-- hello-k8s.yaml
|       |-- kustomize.yaml
|   |--test              # Only diff of changes
|     |-- hello-k8s.yaml
|     |-- kustomize.yaml

$ kubectl apply -k overlays/production # or
$ kustomize build overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Upgrade / Rollback
```bash
$ git pull --rebase && kubectl apply -k overlays/production
$ git checkout <hash> && kubectl apply -f overlays/production
```

---

# Transformations - DTLs (Jsonnet)

Effectively: template syntax, allowing to code templates which are then materialized.
One is "coding" and "inherting" configurations.

```jsonnet
{
  person1: {
    name: "Alice",
    welcome: "Hello " + self.name + "!",
  },
  person2: self.person1 { name: "Bob" },
}
```
into
```yaml
person1:
  name: "Alice"
  welcome: "Hello Alice!"
person2:
  name: "Bob"
  welcome: "Hello Bob!"
```
---

# Transformations - DTLs (Jsonnet)

## Advantages

* Retained most of GitOps goodness
  * Explicit state
  * Deterministic, predictive behaviour
  * Checks most of GitOps boxes (images are not accounted for)
* We easily deal with multi-vector configuration

---

# Transformations - DTLs (Jsonnet)

## Disadvantages

* Typo, typo, typo..
* Requires a bit of tooling
* Using CRDs require some work/scripting
* Helm? Other tools? Everything has to be incorporated manually (or via scripting -> more messy code)
* Still know nothing about images

---

# Side note: Data constraint languages (cue.lang)

### Advantages 
* _IMO:_ The best approach, but incredibly effortful
* They are not turning complete
* There are focused around dealing with multi-dimensional data
* Extremely helpful in validation / type / schema checking (sic!)

### Disadvantages
* Requires a bit of tooling
* Using CRDs require some work/scripting
* Helm? Other tools? Everything has to be incorporated manually (or via scripting -> more messy code)
* Still know nothing about images

---

# Reminder: Image management

In every approach mentioned, container image management was assumed to be already done by some other tool.

Such separation of duties causes a very unnatural rift - entity which should be indivisible unit (manifest & container image), is now decoupled.

## Project state

---

## Goals / Target state

* GitOps
* Each commit is deployable state
* Each change auto-generates full set of deployments and its dependencies
* All dependencies should be clearly stated and pinned
* Each operation should be as portable as possible
* Understanding how pieces fit together should be easy
* Ideally, doing deployment should be trivial

---

# Current project state

* Uses overlays approach (via Kustomize)
* Base manifests are plain `yaml` files
* Helm charts are materialized via `helm template` command
* Each commit represents releasable unit

### Issues

* Helm charts are not referenced explicitly (nor values used to create them)
* Each deployment is not fully materialized (not a plain `yaml` file)
* There is no clear way to reproduce/re-build (collection of manual operations)
* Container images are taken for granted
* Further development will mean more and more glue code
* ...
* Even with effort and good coding, result would be a home-made set of instructions, interconnected with bash, which
may or may not be portable
* We would be arriving at "works on my machine" city

# Short shilling for Bazel

Another build tool?! Why would I need it?! `#stop-hype-driven-development`

Are these looking a bit familiar?

* "The build process is broken, but I don't know why.."
* "Why my build is taking literal ages?"
* "It builds on my machine, CD/CD is failing or vice versa"
* "I haven't changed a thing and the new build has broken down"

If so, perhaps Bazel may be of help.

* It is a polyglot, highly distributed build and test orchestration tool.
* It __does not replace__ your build tools - but it __gives them superpowers__!

# Bazel is

## Incremental
## Deterministic
## Hermetic
## Composable
## Industrial grade

# Argumentum ad populum

.using-bazel[![Using Bazel](img/using-bazel.png)]

---

# Advantages in context of k8s / microservices

* Battle-tested tools for handling containers & manifests
* Wide variety of approaches
* Container image management may be part of the solution
* Every 'build' is a DAG with cachable intermediary steps
* Nearly each-part of it's implementation is virtually written in Python (Skylark to be precise)

## Demo

# Summary

## Creating complete deployment
```bash
# Build images, upload them and generate manifests
$ bazel run kubeview:prod
```

## Apply deployment
```
# (.create, .delete, .replace, .describe also exist)
$ bazel run kubeview:prod.apply
```

## Understand what are the dependencies
```
$ bazel query --noimplicit_deps 'deps(//kubeview:prod)' --output graph
```

---

# Summary

### Using Bazel will

* Allow to clearly define and connect various tasks required for apps deployments
* Encapsulate the logic, so that it can be re-run on different hosts
* Help in reasoning on different dependencies
* Increase the development speed and focus (features, not deployment-glue)
